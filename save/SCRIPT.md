# Slide 1: PLINDERP Integration
"Welcome, everyone! Today, I’m thrilled to discuss the integration of PLIN-DERP with Llama 3.2, a project that is particularly relevant for the upcoming Machine Learning in Structural Biology workshop at the 38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems.

# Slide 2: About `plinderdoibio`
"As part of our project, we've developed a Python package named `plinderp dee oh eye bio`. This package serves as an intuitive interface that simplifies access to citation data via the `plinder dot dee oh eye dot bio` API. Our package
helps researchers unlock the information in the citation, authors, abstract
and full text of the paper.

# Slide 3: Inputs for Integration
"The primary input for our integration is the Protein Data Bank (PDB) code. For instance, entering a code like '1erm' allows us to pull comprehensive information tied to that specific protein-ligand interaction written
directly by the authors of the paper.

# Slide 4: Outputs Available
"Our integration yields a variety of valuable outputs. Users receive a formatted
text version of citations, downloadable PDFs of research papers, markdown
formats for documentation, and direct links to both PubMed ID and PubMed
Central.  These can be leveraged by LLM systems such as Llama 3.2 to unlock
information inside the scientific paper.

# Slide 5: Leveraging the Integration  
"Leveraging these outputs, users can analyze downloaded PDFs using Llama 3.2, extracting insights about protein-ligand interactions that can be used
to enhance the rational drug design process.

# Slide 6: Future Directions
"Looking forward, we plan to gather user feedback to refine the `plinderp dee oh eye bio` package continually. We also aim to expand the integration to include more data sources, ultimately enhancing its utility for researchers. 

# Slide 7: MLSB Workshop Focus
"The MLSB workshop seeks to address several active challenges in structural biology using Protein Large Language models. By developing tools like PLINDERP,
we hope to combine the power of LLMs with Structure Based LLMs to
unlock insights into drug design.

# Slide 8: Upcoming Paper Submission
"In line with the MLSB workshop, I'm excited to share that one of the outputs from this hackathon will be a paper about PLINDERP. This paper will highlight how our integration can provide valuable resources for researchers and facilitate breakthroughs in protein-ligand interaction studies."

# Slide 10: Demo Time!
"And finally, let’s jump into a quick demo! I’ll showcase how to utilize the `plinderp dee oh eye bio` package to fetch citation information from the Plinderp dataset. Please join me as I walk you through its functionalities and demonstrate how it can support your research endeavors in structural biology."
