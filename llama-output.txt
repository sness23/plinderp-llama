The docking site is located at the edge of the enzyme active site, specifically in the van der Waals interactions with the edge β-strand of the enzyme active site (residues 235–238). This second conformation of the side chain phenylacetamido group was unanticipated in our modeling studies and arises from a favorable aromatic stacking interaction of the side chain aromatic group and the phenyl group carrying the carboxylate of the inhibitor and Tyr105 in the enzyme (Figure 3B). Refinement trials indicate that these two conformations exist with approximately equal occupancy in the complex. Conformational Changes in the Position of Active Site Residues. The three polypeptide chains of TEM-1 complexed with inhibitors 1, 2, and 3 superimpose very closely on each other, as well as with the native enzyme (root-mean-square deviations range from 0.17 to 0.24 Å for all α-carbon atoms). There are very few differences in main chain positions, and the only significant differences in side chain positions are observed in the active site residues Tyr105, Ser130, and Glu104 that surround the inhibitor binding site (misd values range from 0.32 to 0.48 Å for all-atom superpositions of the native and the three inhibitors). The small changes observed in these side chain positions reflect the unique nature of each boronate compound. The interactions of Tyr105 (van der Waals) and Ser130 (hydrogen bonding) with inhibitor are affected by the addition of the hydroxyl on the phenyl group in compound 2. Similarly, the van der Waals interactions of Tyr105 and Glu104 with inhibitor are likely affected by the conformation of the bulky phenylacetamido side group in compound 1.

The boronate inhibitors were designed to displace two ordered waters (the deacylating water and the oxyanion hole water) found in a conserved location within the active site of TEM and all other group 2b β-lactamases for which structural information exists. Both of these waters are displaced by the inhibitor in all three boronate complexes as described above. In addition, there is an additional significant displacement of water caused by the phenylacetamido side chain moiety in the high-affinity compound 1. Figure 5 shows an overlap of compounds 1, 2, and 3 along with the corresponding ordered water molecules present in each of the crystallographic structures of the native enzyme.
