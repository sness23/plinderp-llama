# plinderp

plinderp is a supplement to the plinder dataset that adds citation information,
text, pdfs and other metadata associated with entries in plinder.

Plinderp is hosted at plinderp.doi.bio, and for every entry in Plinder, there is
a corresponding entry in Plinderp. For each entry, we cache as much information
at plinderp.doi.bio as we are legally permitted to share, depending on copyright
and licensing agreements. Due to legal reasons, we cannot provide all the
information for each scientific paper. For instance, we are unable to share a
PDF of a Nature paper unless it is publicly accessible. This restriction is in
place to ensure compliance with intellectual property laws and to uphold the
rights of the original authors and publishers. Our goal is to provide as much
relevant information as possible while respecting these legal boundaries,
thereby maintaining the integrity of academic publishing and supporting the
authors' rights to their work.
